# Prompt Engineering with OpenAI

## Overview

This repository provides insights, techniques, and best practices for **Prompt Engineering** using **OpenAI's models**, such as GPT-4. It includes hands-on examples, structured experiments, and strategies to optimize prompts for various applications, including text generation, summarization, question answering, and more.

## Features

- **Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering**: Learn about prompt structure, tokens, and response control.
- **Prompt Optimization Techniques**: Understand how to improve outputs using structured prompts, system messages, and fine-tuning methods.
- **Use Cases & Examples**: Ready-to-use prompts for tasks like chatbots, content generation, and data extraction.
- **API Integration**: How to use OpenAI's API in Python for dynamic prompt execution.
- **Best Practices**: Tips for maximizing accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of AI-generated responses.

## Installation

Clone the repository and set up dependencies:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/uzairafridi00/prompt-engineering.git
 cd prompt-engineering
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Experiment with prompts**: Run the files in `prompt-engineering/` to explore different prompt styles.
2. **API Usage**: Use `scripts/api_example.py` to interact with OpenAI models programmatically.
3. **Modify and Test**: Adapt the prompts based on your needs and analyze the results.

Example usage in Python:

```python
import openai

def generate_response(prompt):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

print(generate_response("Explain Prompt Engineering in simple terms"))
```
